    <h2>About Indy CTF</h2>
    <div class="card">
      <p>
        Indy CTF is a hands-on cybersecurity competition built to help new students break into the CTF world without the fear or pressure that usually pushes people away. It’s designed as a safe, low-stress environment where beginners can learn, experiment, and compete while still getting the rush of solving real challenges.
      </p>
      <p>
        Teams of up to four players work together to solve digital puzzles across multiple categories. Everything is structured so newcomers can actually participate and succeed, not sit confused for four hours. If you’ve ever been curious about cybersecurity, this is the easiest on-ramp you’ll ever get.
      </p>

    <h2>Challenge Format</h2>
    <div class="card">
      <p>
        The event uses a Jeopardy-style scoring format. Each challenge has a short description and a flag to find. Harder challenges award more points, and the live scoreboard updates as teams progress.
      </p>
      <p>
        All categories are included except programming-heavy or Linux-terminal–dependent challenges. These challenges focus on accessibility and learning, not gatekeeping.
