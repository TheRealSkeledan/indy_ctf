  <h2>The Challenge</h2>
  <p><strong>COMING SOON</strong></p>
  <p>
    The specific categories, point breakdowns, and challenge details will be revealed at the start of the competition. Expect a mix of classic CTF styles: forensics, OSINT, cryptography, web, steganography, and more. No heavy coding or Linux-based terminal knowledge required — we keep it accessible.
  </p>

  <h2>What to Expect</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>You'll get a clear set of challenges and point values when the event begins.</li>
    <li>You'll work in teams of up to four to solve puzzles across different cybersecurity categories.</li>
    <li>All challenges are designed to help you learn, not overwhelm you — perfect for first-timers.</li>
    <li>No programming or terminal-heavy tasks. Everything is doable with guided reasoning and tools provided.</li>
    <li>The environment is supportive, relaxed, and meant to build confidence.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>What to Bring</h2>

    <li>An open mind and willingness to try something new.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Prizes</h2>
  <p>
    Prizes are TBD, but expect them to be legitimately good — not the usual “sticker and handshake” type. Every team walks away with something, but top teams will get the best rewards.
